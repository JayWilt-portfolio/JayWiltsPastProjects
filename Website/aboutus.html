			<p>The Goldenrod Steakhouse is a family-owned restaurant founded in 1994. The owner believes in bringing local grown and raised food to local farmers and tourists visiting the Mammoth Cave National Park. The restaurant uses historical farming equipment on the walls to give a little more identity to the historical aspect of rural Kentucky. The steaks are fresh and grown from the surrounding area. Local farmers market provides a good assortment of vegetables and potatoes. With reasonable prices and friendly staff, we hope to make your night with us a night to remember. We have been given excellent ratings from local food critics as well as many satisfied customers.
			</p>
			<p>A few major things to think about for your future visits. We have seasonal specials 5 days a week. All the fried food is done using peanut oil so please be advised for those with peanut allergies. While Hart County is a moist county, we do not currently serve alcohol for the safety of our community and those visiting the area. Letâ€™s not forget about the desserts. Our strawberry cake is made from locally grown strawberries and is one of the most popular items on the menu. All desserts are made fresh daily and change often. We pride ourselves on helping the community and work with the local schools to provide help for the needy especially during holidays. The difference between Goldenrod Steakhouse and popular chain steakhouses are we do not get are food delivered by truck. Everything you taste will be grown here in Kentucky and as such will always be of the highest quality.
