			<p>John Duvall began planning for the Goldenrod Steakhouse in 1992. From the time of the first draft, it was always going to be a steakhouse. John just did not know what the aesthetic would be like yet. John then began cleaning out his grandfatherâ€™s barn and found some antique farm equipment and decided to use family heirlooms for the decorations as each piece would tell a story. Before the grand opening of the restaurant, his niece was drawing a field with some goldenrod flowers. John liked this picture so much that it became the logo of the restaurant. The grand opening of the restaurant was March 13, 1994.</p>
