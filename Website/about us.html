			<p style=color:#EAE911>The Goldenrod Steakhouse is a family-owned restaurant founded in 1994. The owner believes in bringing local grown and raised food to local farmers and tourists visiting the Mammoth Cave National Park. The restaurant uses historical farming equipment on the walls to give a little more identity to the historical aspect of rural Kentucky. The steaks are fresh and grown from the surrounding area. Local farmers market provides a good assortment of vegetables and potatoes. With reasonable prices and friendly staff, we hope to make your night with us a night to remember.

			<p style=color:#EAE911>A few major things to think about for your future visits. We have seasonal specials 5 days a week. All the fried food is done using peanut oil so please be advised for those with peanut allergies. While Hart County is a moist county, we do not currently serve alcohol for the safety of our community and those visiting the area.
